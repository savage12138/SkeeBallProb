# Skee Ball Probability
Probabilistic algorithms and/or stochastic simulation are often used to estimate values or predict the likelihood of specific events, particularly if direct calculation is algorithmically complex or involves interactions that are difficult to formally characterize, but easy to simulate computationally. This program will evelop a computational simulation of the game Skee Ball to experimentally estimate various results. 

Most programming languages and computing systems include the ability to generate random values, typically in the form of a uniformly distributedreal number between 0 and 1.  By appropriately scaling and shifting this value, a uniform distribution between any two real numbers can be easily obtained.  Non-uniform distributions, such as a Gaussian (normal) function, maybe derived by treatingthe system-generated value as the cumulative probability density and working backward to calculate the desiredfunction parameter.

Many applications require discrete random values distributed according to specified probabilities.  For equally likely values, the uniform random value can be scaled and then converted to an integer.  To avoid issues related to whether or not the 0 and 1 boundary values may occur, the scaled value can be shifted by 0.5 and rounded to generate a series of equally likely integers.  For example, the roll of a single die can be simulated by the following calculation:D  =  ROUND (6* RAN() + 0.5)which takes a random value in the range (0, 1), maps it to a value in the range (0.5, 6.5), and then rounds it to an integer in the range [1, 6].
